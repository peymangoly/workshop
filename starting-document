Known limitation / bugs

There are limitation such as running environment, for-while-case loop, and calculation resource for other range.
We have issue in generating file on space that we have not permission. And our bash script atrributes for run may lose inorder to move and copy.
Also we may have troubles and bugs in shuf and sort commands.
